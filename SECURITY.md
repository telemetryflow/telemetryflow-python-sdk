# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of TelemetryFlow Core seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
- **Security Team**: security@telemetryflow.id
- **Project Lead**: support@telemetryflow.id

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability** and how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

### Disclosure Policy

- Security issues will be disclosed after a fix is available
- We will credit researchers who report vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- We follow responsible disclosure practices

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Never commit .env files
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Use strong secrets
pnpm run generate:secrets
```

#### 2. Database Security
```bash
# Use strong passwords
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>

# Restrict database access
# Only allow connections from trusted IPs
```

#### 3. JWT Configuration
```bash
# Use minimum 32 characters for secrets
JWT_SECRET=<min-32-chars-random-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<min-32-chars-random-string>

# Set appropriate expiration
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h  # Adjust based on your needs
```

#### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Always use NODE_ENV=production
NODE_ENV=production

# Disable debug logs
LOG_LEVEL=warn

# Enable HTTPS only
# Use reverse proxy (nginx/traefik) with SSL/TLS
```

### For Contributors

#### 1. Code Security

**Never commit:**
- Passwords or API keys
- Private keys or certificates
- Database credentials
- JWT secrets
- Personal information

**Always:**
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize database queries
- Use parameterized queries (TypeORM handles this)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

#### 2. Dependencies

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
pnpm audit fix

# Update dependencies regularly
pnpm update
```

#### 3. Code Review

All code changes must:
- Pass security review
- Include tests for security-critical features
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Be reviewed by at least one maintainer

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token generation
- **5-tier RBAC system** (Super Admin, Admin, Developer, Viewer, Demo)
- **Permission-based access control** with 22+ granular permissions
- **Password hashing** using Argon2 (industry standard)
- **Session management** with secure session secrets

### Data Protection

- **PostgreSQL** for transactional data with row-level security
- **ClickHouse** for audit logs and observability data
- **Encrypted connections** between services
- **Input validation** using class-validator
- **SQL injection prevention** via TypeORM parameterized queries

### Observability & Monitoring

- **Audit logging** for all critical operations
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** for request tracking
- **Winston logging** with structured logs
- **Health checks** for service monitoring

### Network Security

- **Docker network isolation** (172.151.151.0/24)
- **Service-to-service communication** on private network
- **Exposed ports** only for necessary services
- **CORS configuration** for API access control
